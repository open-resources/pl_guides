# Tips for Randomizing questions

Below are some practical suggestions on effectively randomizing questions for a course.

- Start with a randomized question and immerse yourself into and try to understand each part of it. 
- It's usually better to create all the questions you need for your course before trying to randomize them.
- But, before creating dozens of questions for a course, you should first try to fully and completely randomize a handful of questions (of different types) to develop some intuition and skills on how randomization works in PrairieLearn.
- Then, work on creating a good template for your questions so you (or a TA!) can easily randomize the question by adding to a dictionary, list, csv file, etc...
- Test **every** question! Test it again! Now ask other people to test your questions.

## Energy and effort

- In general, it is much, much, harder to create questions (even non-randomized ones) from scratch, than to randomize an existing question.
- Randomizing question is lots of fun but also a huge time sink! 
- Try and think about the pedagogical benefit of randomizing questions - does it allow you to do more creative and interesting things in your course (extra practice, frequent testing, multiple assessments or reassessments, alternative grading, etc...)
- For a novice coder, it can take upwards of an hour to randomize and test a single question (be patient - you will get faster and more efficient!).
- For an experienced coder, budget about 20 minutes to randomize and test an existing question.
- Multi-part questions are more sophisticated and have more moving parts, and will take longer to randomize (and test).
