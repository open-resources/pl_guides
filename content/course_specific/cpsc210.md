Below are some additional notes and details specifically for CPSC 210.

## Existing questions in CPSC 210

For your convenience, relevant questions have been moved into this directory: `questions/2023W1/midterm1`
For TAs working on questions for "Part 1" (multiple choice, checkbox, drop downs, fill in the blanks) of the Midterms/Exams, you should explore those questions.
For TAs working on questions for "Part 2" (Workspaces and autograded questions) of the Midterms/Exams, you should explore questions from both Part 1 and Part 2.

TAs working on questions for Part 2 will need some additional training and instruction, which will be provided at a later date.
