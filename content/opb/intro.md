# Markdown and PrairieLearn

```{warning}
This section is currently under development and should not be consumed by people that aren't already using the PrairieLearn-Markdown authoring system in the "Open Problem Bank".

## Notes from Irene Vrbik

### Mark down system

Firas didn't like how there were three files for each question, so he came up with this markdown system that they would create a single file and through some GitHub action it would convert those markdown files into the three files.

## Reviewing Questions

The way we have set it up, we will not be editing the questions in PL, nor the corresponding GitHub repo.
Instead we will be reviewing questions in a separate GitHub repo: https://github.com/open-resources/instructor_stats_bank.
Here we will be reviewing the markdown files (as described in [Mark down system], these md files get converted to the 3 files we need for a PL question).

To start your review, click the `Add your review` at the top of the page: 

![](../teaching/irene_intro/add-your-review.png)

Once you click that button, you will be shown all the files that are being changed in that pull request.
If you want to make a comment about a particular line(s)^[Multiline comments can be made but clicking and dragging] of code, click the "+" sign and leave a comment:

Even if you are not asked to do a review, you can still click on a question  and select the `Files Changed`:

![](../teaching/irene_intro/sample-question.png)

At the top of the md file, you will see the title of the question

![](../teaching/irene_intro/question-title.png)

Assuming this question has already been moved to PL, you can search for this question name as described in [PrairieLearn Search].  

> Question: Ask Firas how questions are moved to PL (some questions I am reviewing are not showing up here yet).
